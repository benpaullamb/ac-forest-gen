## About this Project

An aesthetic random forest generator for Animal Crossing: New Horizons

![Screenshot of the app](./screenshot.png)

I wanted to create a natural looking forest in the game Animal Crossing: New Horizons. The spacing between the trees needed to be a certain distance horizontally and vertically in order to not obscure too much vision of the things around/behind them.
